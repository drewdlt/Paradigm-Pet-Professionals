This repository was created to showcase the website I designed and created for my User Interface Design course at Western Governors University.
The design and coding process took roughly 3 weeks with a majority of it spent on redisigning unwanted designs.

This is my first time working with media queries so the layout and implementation of them may not align to best practices.
It was also my first time implementing JavaScript into my HTML so there is not much present apart from being used for the collapsable navbar.

The prompt of the assignment was to redesign and create a website that would properly address user stories as well as to add additional features such as
a proper home page, an additional webpage for bird owners, an about us page, and a consultation page that housed a consultation form that would ask the visitor to enter imformation
about themselves and their pet.
